# RGIG V4 Example Logs & Audits

This folder contains sample run logs and audit files for each RGIG field (A–G, future H–Z).

## How to Use
- After running the CLI or Tab UI, export your results as `rgig_run.json` and place a copy here for reference.
- Each file should be named by field or run (e.g., `fieldA_demo.json`, `rgig_run_example.json`).
- Use these examples to:
  - Validate your own outputs
  - Test peer review and audit workflows
  - Share reproducible results with the community

## Format
- All logs are JSON or YAML, checksummed for transparency.
- See `/fields/` for schema details per field.

## Contributing
- Add new examples for new fields or edge cases.
- See [../docs/CONTRIBUTING.md] for details.
